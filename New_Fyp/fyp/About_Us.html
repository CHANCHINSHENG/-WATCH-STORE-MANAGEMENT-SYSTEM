            <h2><span class="emoji">📖</span> Our Story: More Than Just Time</h2>
            <p class="story-intro">
                Ever felt that a watch is more than just a device for telling time? That it’s a whisper of your personality, a defining touch to your daily ensemble, a silent storyteller of your moments? 
                That’s the very belief that sparked <span class="highlight">TIGO Fashion Watch</span> into existence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps "TIGO" for us is a nod to <span class="highlight">"Time's Greatest Offerings"</span> or maybe it signifies our core values: <span class="highlight">Trendy, Genuine, Outstanding</span>. 
                What truly matters is the passion that drives us. Founded in <span class="placeholder-text">2025</span> by a team of avid watch lovers right here in Melaka, we noticed a gap. 
                Where were the go-to places for truly fashionable watches that didn't just follow trends, but set them, and didn't break the bank? And so, TIGO Fashion Watch was born – from a desire to share our love for standout timepieces with you.
